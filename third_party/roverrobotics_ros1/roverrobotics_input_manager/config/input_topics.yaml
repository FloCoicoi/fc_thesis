# Input stamped command velocities
# For each topic:
# - sub_topic    : name of topic to subscribe to that publishes geometry_msgs::TwistStamped
# - pub_topic    : name of topic to publish the managed output
# - timeout : timeout in seconds to start discarding old messages with expired stamps. 0.0 or less never trigger timeout
# - stamped : Boolean that specifies whether the output from the relay should be TwistStamped of Twist
#
# The cmd_vel/freedom topic is specifically dedicated for the use by https://www.freedomrobotics.ai.
# The timeout is set to 0.0 because network latency can vary greatly and should be set to meet your needs.
